@ when first number is divisible by 3 (0*, 3*, 6* etc.) the channel describe background for Lambda(1520) diLepton decay
@ when first number is even (2*, 4*, 6* etc.) the channel describe background for cascade production
@ when firs number is divisible by 2 and 3 (0*,6*), channel belongs to both simulations
